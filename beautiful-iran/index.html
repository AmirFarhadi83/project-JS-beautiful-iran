                  curved lines, and repeating this process eventually leads to the appearance of bright shadows and
                  volume in the image. Calligraphy and writing are two main pillars in Iranian painting.</p>

            <p>Iran's culture is very rich, civilized and Iran's historical cultural heritage is unparalleled in the
              world. Iranian people also remember their culture with awareness. As a historical country, Iran has seen
              empires such as the Achaemenid Empire in ancient times, and despite political, religious and historical
              changes, Iranians have maintained a deep connection with their past. Although daily life in modern Iran
              was mixed with Shia Islam, the country's native art, literature and architecture are reminders of its deep
              national tradition and a broader literary culture that spread across the Middle East and South Asia in
              earlier times. From a cultural point of view, most of Iran's modern history was devoted to the tension
              between Shia religion and Iranian cultural heritage.</p>

            <p>Iranshahr includes the geographical area and civilization area of the Iranian plateau and its adjacent
              plains, including Iran, a large part of the Caucasus and Central Asia. The historical use of Iran includes
              all the political borders of the country that was dominated by the Iranians, as well as the Middle River
              and most of Armenia and the South Caucasus.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">

                Hegel, the great German philosopher, considers Iranians to be the first historical nation and the
                Iranian
                Empire as the first empire in history. When talking about the history of Iran, one should pay attention
                to
                whether it means the history of the nations and peoples who have lived in the political borders of
                today's
                Iran since the beginning of history, or the history of the nations and peoples who call themselves
                Iranian
                in some way and have lived in the geography that includes today's Iran and the lands that historically
                have been a part of Greater Iran (Iranshahr). Iran Sometimes the history of Iran begins with the arrival
                of the Aryans, from whom the name Iran is also derived, to the Iranian plateau; But this does not mean
                that the plateau of Iran was uninhabited or uncivilized before their arrival. Before the arrival of the
                Aryans in the plateau of Iran, very ancient civilizations had flourished and withered in this place, and
                some were still flourishing. For example, the Nushijan civilization in Malair Shahr Sokhte (in Sistan
                and
                Baluchistan), the civilization of the inhabitants of Silk Hill (in Kashan), the Ilam civilization (in
                the
                north of Khuzestan), the Minaian civilization (in Bukan, Kurdistan and south of West Azerbaijan), the
                Parsava civilization (in Piranshahr), the Jiroft civilization (in Kerman), the Elipi kingdom (in
                Kermanshah (the capital) and Kurdistan), the Lulubian civilization (in Kermanshah (the capital),
                Kurdistan
                and Azerbaijan), the Gutians (in Kurdistan, Kermanshah and Azerbaijan). (Azerbaijan), Hasanlu Hill in
                South
                West Azerbaijan, Ganj Dara Civilization (in Harsin, Kermanshah), Ziviyeh Civilization (in Saqqez,
                Kurdistan), Goran Hill Civilization (in Gilangarb, Kermanshah), Sheikhi Abad and Jani Hill Civilization
                (in Dinur, Kermanshah), Godin Hill Civilization (in Kangavar, Kermanshah), Ali Kash Hill in Ilam,
                Eskandari (in Hefshjan), Urartu Civilization (in Azerbaijan), Hesar Hill (in Damghan Semnan), Shahdad
                Hill
                (in Kerman), Tepe Gyan (in Nahavand Hamedan), Kasi civilization (first among Rodan and then in Zagros),
                Tapours in Tabarstan (Mazandaran) and... were in the land of Iran.

                Iran before history
                Main articles: Iran before history and the chronology of Iranian history from cave dwelling to the rise
                of
                the Achaemenids
                The pre-historical period or pre-historic era is the period of time before the recording of history or
                the
                invention of the writing system. In this period, humans were not yet able to record and report their
                lives
                and achievements, and human experiences and achievements were quickly lost. During one hundred and fifty
                years of archaeological excavations in Iran, the prehistoric era of Iran has not been explored in the
                same
                way; While extensive explorations have been done in the western and southern regions, the northern and
                eastern regions have remained relatively unexplored. The Paleolithic era has been neglected. On the
                other
                hand, the Neolithic period has been studied considerably in order to study the formation of a
                succession.
                Little attention has been paid to the Early and Middle Copper Age. However, the Late Copper Age has been
                well studied in order to investigate the formation of the state. The study of the Early Bronze Age also
                suffers from the same heterogeneity. While the pre-Elamite period has been the subject of interest in
                exploration, the Yanik culture in northwestern Iran has been neglected. The urbanization process and
                exchanges between regions have been investigated in the Middle Bronze Age, but the Late Bronze Age and
                the
                Early Iron Age have not been investigated. The periods after that is the period of the formation of the
                Median and Achaemenid states, which has been studied a lot.</span>

                  temons,
                  qabas, hats, shawls and scarves.

                  Abyaneh men's "shirt" changes according to the season and weather conditions. This shirt is
                  usually
                  round-necked and its lower part is similar to the men's shirts of Gilan and Mazandaran.

                  "Tamon" is the same as Abianeh's men's pants, which are long, black in color, with a waist and two
                  wide legs (the width of the soles reaches 90-100 cm). The decorations on the bottom of the pants
                  show
                  whether people are married or single; So that diamond-shaped embroidery is sewn for single people

                  smooth lines around the legs for married people.
                  "Qaba" is, in fact, a coat-like garment that has slits on both sides, and the pocket is placed on
                  top
                  of the slit, and the pocket bag is secretly sewn under the quba. Qaba has a left and right collar
                  and
                  it is sewn from colored and striped fabrics. A triangular cloth is also sewn on the sides of the
